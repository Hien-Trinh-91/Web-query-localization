In WebQuery one can input an address, choose from a list of addresses click the link and it will tell you the school name walk distance drive distance and if the child is eligible for transportation. (advantage) Can choose/ find the closest stop to their home (advantage) By giving community members this access, WebQuery can eliminate a call to transportation for this information making community members self-sufficient. (Benefit) Gives a map representation of closest stops Some clients will put this map on their main webpage, some clients do not deploy this map to everyone but just to district staff All based off of how much information they should be putting out to the public Not your job to convince school district what their policy should be. WebQuery has two kinds of customers Those that must register for bus Those that assign every eligible kid These districts are where WebQuery is usually published Other information Toronto’s WebQuery is a good one to look at for instructions on how to use WebQuery Not sure which fields can be customized. He takes these needs one at a time. Sometimes we will charge for customization but this is a one off There is also a program field, problem is that it’s abbreviated using Edulog lingo. This can be difficult for parents to use. WebQuery does not have to make put stop info available to the public. It can be school of attendance and eligibility only.",
